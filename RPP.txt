Red Pepper Pasta Recipe

Ingredients:

1 box of pasta
½ onion, diced
3 garlic cloves, minced
1 12-ounce jar of roasted red peppers
4 tablespoons of butter, divided
⅓ cup of vegetable broth
½ cup of half and half or heavy whipping cream
Grated Parmesan cheese, to taste
Frozen peas
Canned mushrooms
Red pepper flakes, to taste
Instructions:

In a large skillet, sauté diced onion and minced garlic in 3 tablespoons of butter until the onion is translucent.

Add the drained roasted red peppers to the skillet and sauté for 3-5 minutes.

Transfer the onion and pepper mixture to a blender. Add half & half, vegetable broth, a sprinkle of grated Parmesan cheese, a pinch of salt, and red pepper flakes to taste. Blend until smooth.

Using the same skillet, sauté the mushrooms in the remaining tablespoon of butter until soft.

Cook the pasta according to the package directions. When there is one minute of cooking time left, add the frozen peas to the pasta water to soften.

Drain the pasta and peas, and return them to the pot (use a larger pot if necessary to accommodate all ingredients).

While the pasta is still hot, stir in the red pepper sauce and sautéed mushrooms.

Serve with as much grated Parmesan cheese as desired.

Notes:

Adjust the amount of red pepper flakes to control the spiciness of the dish.
Ensure to drain the roasted red peppers well before adding to the skillet.
The sauce can be prepared ahead of time and reheated when ready to serve.
